## CAD Software

CAD stands for 'Software Aided Design'. CAD Software is a special type of 3D software that focuses on design of 3D models for 3D printing or manufacturing. You want to learn CAD software if you want to design your own structure for your robots.

### [OnShape](https://www.onshape.com/en/)

OnShape is a popular cloud-based CAD software. We recommend Onshape as it does not require any download or installation process. It is free as long as your designs remain public so is a low-friction path for CAD learning.
